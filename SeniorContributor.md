Q. Is this just about money?
A. No, salary ladders give insight to what companies value.

### Time

Online are many references. Some, like this one:

<http://sijinjoseph.com/programmer-competency-matrix/>

One thing that is evident from online searches:

> There is no fixed length of time before becoming "senior"

---

### Giving Back

Much of what I learned about computers came from books, blog posts, and trial/error. This means I benefited from the generous gift of knowledge from those who figured those things before me.

Not suggesting I am the first person with these perspectives, but, most of what I am telling you today is not from any mentor, or book. I learned this the hard way. Hopefully, the perspectives are useful.

## Master Principle

![Project Triangle](images/Project-triangle-en.svg)

source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle>

---

> The discipline of project management is about providing the tools and techniques that enable the project team (not just the project manager) to organize their work to meet these constraints.

Not a talk on project management, but in a nutshell:

> Being senior is about helping your boss/client do more, with less, and of high quality.
