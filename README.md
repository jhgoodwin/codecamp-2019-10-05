# CodeCamp 2019 sessions

This year, I will be giving two talks:

- [How to be a Senior Contributor](./SeniorContributor.md)
  > Ever wonder what causes some team members to be recognized early in their careers as senior contributors, while others are intermediate for much longer? I will break this down in small and precise details with many example scenarios.
- [Not your Daddy's Docker 101](./Docker101.md)
  > Just about every Docker 101 out there starts with how to run things, spinning up processes, and progresses into other neat things it can do. We may start with running a container, but instead of moving forward, we will move backward to the basics and explain how things are connected, how you can know what will happen, how to know what went wrong, and how to know exactly what the heck is going on.
  > As an added bonus, we will review exactly what went into each layer of your docker image.
  > Session backed by 100% money back guarantee
